# Writing Samples (Consumer Behavior/Psychology)
## :writing_hand: Repository Introduction
My primary research interests lie in the consumer behavior field, including topics such as Judgment and Decision Making (JDM), Rewards and Motivation, and Pricing Discrimination. As a dedicated researcher with a strong foundation in consumer behavior and psychology, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor, technical expertise, and cross-cultural insights to every project I undertake. My experience spans designing and executing complex experiments and surveys, conducting holistic data analysis, and developing actionable insights that support informed business decision-making. This repository contains selected work from my experiences regarding consumer behavior and psychological research. Specifically, there are three literature review samples and three independent research writing samples.

1. **Consumer Behavior Research Paper**
- [View the paper](./2022_CB%20Review%20Paper.pdf)
This paper is my first literature review and application paper in the consumer behavior research field, which was finished in 2022. This paper critically evaluated essentialist theories and social constructivism’s
impacts on gender-based colour preference differences, further providing improvement suggestions on Disney’s
marketing strategies that reinforce gender stereotypes. Additionally, it analyzed different genders’ mating preferences from the
evolutionary perspective and offered recommendations on the Tinder APP’s optimization of user experiences. The last section of this paper
compared benign and malicious envy’s different impacts on consumers’ tendency for social comparison and
leveraged Burberry as an example to discuss insightful business implications for the luxury and fashion industry. 

2. **Selected Consumer Behavior Research Literature Review**
- [View the paper](./2022-2023_Selected%20Literature%20Reviews.pdf)
This paper contains three selected literature reviews on the research projects I engaged in, where I built the hypotheses and wrote up complete literature review, designed experiments/surveys to collect data, and performed rigorous data analysis. The first project (2022) posited that Mortality salience has different effects on people with different extent of self-esteem. Under 
mortality salience, high self-esteem people are more likely to engage in activities that help regain 
self-control and keep a balanced state while avoiding indulgent consumption and giving-up 
behaviors. However, low self-esteem people tend to ignore self-esteem-related activities more and 
conduct indulgent consumption under mortality salience. Symmetrical patterns in product designs 
arouse feelings of balance, stability, and calmness. In contrast, asymmetrical patterns provide a 
sense of novelty and rule-breaking. Thus, the research proposed that under mortality salience, high self-esteem 
people tend to prefer symmetrical designs and patterns, which helps achieve a balanced state. In 
contrast, low self-esteem people are less likely to prefer symmetrical product designs and artworks. The second project (2022) proposed that under the priming of COVID-19 pandemic, the self-discrepancy (i.e., the gap between 
individuals’ ideal self and actual self) become more distinct. Based on the escape 
theory and Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model, people tend to increase the 
escapism from self-discrepancy and conduct compensatory behaviors, which boosts 
their desire for fantasy appeals and surrealistic things to distract themselves from the 
real world. The third project (2023) posited that when people feel they are socially excluded (i.e., a state of being 
alone, isolated, or ostracized by other individuals or social groups), their self-discrepancy 
(i.e., the gap between the actual self and ideal self) tends to increase, which drives them to 
conduct compensatory behaviors to fill the gap. As one response mechanism, some people 
are more likely to immerse in escapism, distract themselves from reality, and engage in 
distant realms (e.g., hedonic and indulgent consumption). As significant hedonic stimuli, 
fantasy appeals and surrealistic things tend to facilitate escapism. Thus, the study proposed that 
individuals are more likely to prefer fantasy appeals and surrealistic cues when socially 
excluded than in the control situation.

3. **Disney Plus Pricing Strategy Analysis**
- [View the paper](./2023_Disney%20Plus%20Pricing%20Analysis.pdf)
 Specifically, the report first focuses on Disney + streaming media services and introduces the main 4P strategies, US consumer analysis, and competitor analysis 
(including cost comparison) of Disney +. Then, the report comprehensively illustrates the pricing mechanism of Disney +’s new pricing strategies following the three main changes and uses Conjoint Analysis to justify and summarize the 
mechanism. After these, the report analyzes the effects of Disney +’s new pricing structure from the standpoints of the 
company (profit-driven) and customers (social response). Last but not least, the report brings up the questions that 
emerged from the new pricing policy and provides future directions for Disney + to compete more effectively.

4. **Undergraduate Research Awards: Comparing Pink Tax’s Impact on Female Consumers’ Price Fairness Perception and Buying Intention between Luxury and Utilitarian Products**
- [View the paper](./2024_Independent%20Research_Pink%20Tax.pdf)
 The pink tax is a gender-based price discrimination in which women are usually charged 
more than men for products and services with the same efficacy. Previous studies have indicated 
that women showed significantly lower price fairness perceptions of daily necessities (utilitarian) 
products with the pink tax than men, which may lead to lower buying intentions. The present study 
expands the research by examining whether the pink tax’s negative effects on female consumers’ 
price fairness perceptions and buying intentions persist for luxury products. Additionally, this study 
also investigates the pink tax’s impacts on women’s attitudes toward work. By adopting a 2 (price: 
pink tax vs. equal) ×2 (product category: utilitarian vs. luxury) mixed design with product category 
as the repeated variable (N = 228), the current study compared female participants’ price fairness 
perceptions and buying intentions for both utilitarian and luxury products, and their attitudes toward 
work under the pink tax with those who exposed to equal prices. The findings revealed that though 
female participants had significantly lower price fairness perceptions and buying intentions for both 
utilitarian and luxury products under the pink tax, these negative impacts were more prominent for 
utilitarian than luxury products, indicating the product category’s moderating effect. Meanwhile, the 
results indicated that female participants were more likely to show negative attitudes toward work 
under the pink tax. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the pink tax’s 
negative impacts on female consumers’ purchase decision-making and work attitudes as employees, 
calling for companies to engage in practices that eliminate the pink tax and human resource 
management to narrow the gender pay gap and alleviate the pink tax’s economic burden on women.

5. **Measuring Self-Discrepancy: A Critical Review and Comparison of Three Psychological Scales Identifying the Gap Between Actual Self and Ideal Self**
- [View the paper](./2025_Self%20Discrepancy%20Scale%20Review.pdf)
This 
paper reviews three psychological measurements of self-discrepancy from different time 
frames with respective strengths and limitations, aiming to provide application advice in 
different populations and contexts based on each’s reliabilities and validities.
