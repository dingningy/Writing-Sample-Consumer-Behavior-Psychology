# Writing Samples (Consumer Behavior/Psychology)
## :writing_hand: Repository Introduction
As a dedicated researcher with a strong foundation in consumer behavior and psychology, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor, technical expertise, and cross-cultural insights to every project I undertake. My experience spans designing and executing complex experiments and surveys, conducting holistic data analysis, and developing actionable insights that support informed business decision-making and resolve real-world challenges such as marketing strategy and gender inequality. This repository contains selected work from my experiences regarding consumer behavior and psychological research. Specifically, there are three literature review samples and three independent research writing samples.

This paper is my first literature review and application paper in the consumer behavior research field, which was finished in 2022. This paper critically evaluated essentialist theories and social constructivism’s
impacts on gender-based colour preference differences, further providing improvement suggestions on Disney’s
marketing strategies that reinforce gender stereotypes. Additionally, it analyzed different genders’ mating preferences from the
evolutionary perspective and offered recommendations on the Tinder APP’s optimization of user experiences. The last section of this paper
compared benign and malicious envy’s different impacts on consumers’ tendency for social comparison and
leveraged Burberry as an example to discuss insightful business implications for the luxury and fashion industry.
