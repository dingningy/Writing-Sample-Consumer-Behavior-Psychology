# Writing Samples (Consumer Behavior/Psychology)
## :writing_hand: Repository Introduction
My primary research interests lie in the consumer behavior field, including topics such as Judgment and Decision Making (JDM), Rewards and Motivation, and Pricing Discrimination. As a dedicated researcher with a strong foundation in consumer behavior and psychology, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor, technical expertise, and cross-cultural insights to every project I undertake. My experience spans designing and executing complex experiments and surveys, conducting holistic data analysis, and developing actionable insights that support informed business decision-making. This repository contains selected work from my experiences regarding consumer behavior and psychological research. Specifically, there are three literature review samples and three independent research writing samples.

1. **Consumer Behavior Research Paper**

This paper is my first literature review and application paper in the consumer behavior research field, which was finished in 2022. This paper critically evaluated essentialist theories and social constructivism’s
impacts on gender-based colour preference differences, further providing improvement suggestions on Disney’s
marketing strategies that reinforce gender stereotypes. Additionally, it analyzed different genders’ mating preferences from the
evolutionary perspective and offered recommendations on the Tinder APP’s optimization of user experiences. The last section of this paper
compared benign and malicious envy’s different impacts on consumers’ tendency for social comparison and
leveraged Burberry as an example to discuss insightful business implications for the luxury and fashion industry. 

2. **Selected Consumer Behavior Research Literature Review**

This paper contains three selected literature reviews on the research projects I engaged in, where I built the hypotheses and wrote up complete literature review, designed experiments/surveys to collect data, and performed rigorous data analysis. The first project (2022) posited that Mortality salience has different effects on people with different extent of self-esteem. Under 
mortality salience, high self-esteem people are more likely to engage in activities that help regain 
self-control and keep a balanced state while avoiding indulgent consumption and giving-up 
behaviors. However, low self-esteem people tend to ignore self-esteem-related activities more and 
conduct indulgent consumption under mortality salience. Symmetrical patterns in product designs 
arouse feelings of balance, stability, and calmness. In contrast, asymmetrical patterns provide a 
sense of novelty and rule-breaking. Thus, the research proposed that under mortality salience, high self-esteem 
people tend to prefer symmetrical designs and patterns, which helps achieve a balanced state. In 
contrast, low self-esteem people are less likely to prefer symmetrical product designs and artworks. The second project (2022) proposed that under the priming of COVID-19 pandemic, the self-discrepancy (i.e., the gap between 
individuals’ ideal self and actual self) become more distinct. Based on the escape 
theory and Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model, people tend to increase the 
escapism from self-discrepancy and conduct compensatory behaviors, which boosts 
their desire for fantasy appeals and surrealistic things to distract themselves from the 
real world. The third project (2023) posited that when people feel they are socially excluded (i.e., a state of being 
alone, isolated, or ostracized by other individuals or social groups), their self-discrepancy 
(i.e., the gap between the actual self and ideal self) tends to increase, which drives them to 
conduct compensatory behaviors to fill the gap. As one response mechanism, some people 
are more likely to immerse in escapism, distract themselves from reality, and engage in 
distant realms (e.g., hedonic and indulgent consumption). As significant hedonic stimuli, 
fantasy appeals and surrealistic things tend to facilitate escapism. Thus, the study proposed that 
individuals are more likely to prefer fantasy appeals and surrealistic cues when socially 
excluded than in the control situation.
